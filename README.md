# Warehouse Assessment

A mobile-first, tap-driven warehouse assessment demo. A self-contained proof-of-concept showing how facility inspections can be reduced from a long desktop form to a sub-5-minute mobile walkthrough where everything defaults to "OK" and only exceptions require interaction.

This repository is a reference implementation intended to show how a default-OK, zone-guided assessment app can work on a phone. The demo app is fully functional standalone — no external dependencies beyond npm packages.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RPIFisherman/warehouse-assessment.git
cd warehouse-assessment
cd backend && npm install && cd ..
cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in Chrome (use DevTools mobile viewport for the phone experience).

The backend runs on port 3001, the frontend on port 5173. The frontend dev server proxies `/api` and `/uploads` to the backend.

### Optional: Expose via Tunnel (Cloudflare, ngrok, etc.)

If you want to access the dev server from a public hostname (e.g. so a colleague can reach it from their phone over the internet), create a `.env.local` file in **both** `frontend/` and `backend/` with your hostname. These files are gitignored so your personal hostnames never get committed.

```bash
# frontend/.env.local
ALLOWED_HOSTS=my-tunnel.trycloudflare.com,staging.example.com

# backend/.env.local
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://my-tunnel.trycloudflare.com,https://staging.example.com
```

Both files support comma-separated lists. Copy from the provided `.env.example` templates in each directory as a starting point. Restart `npm run dev` after editing.

Without a `.env.local`, the dev server only accepts `localhost` — safe by default.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend framework | Vue 3.4 + TypeScript + Vite 5 |
| UI library | Element Plus 2.8 + Tailwind CSS 3.4 |
| State management | Pinia |
| Routing | Vue Router 4 |
| Backend framework | Express 4 + TypeScript |
| Database | SQLite via better-sqlite3 |
| File uploads | Multer |
| Process orchestration | concurrently |

The frontend uses a CSS variable-based design system with a blue brand and dark mode by default.

## Key Features

### Default-OK Pattern
Every checklist item defaults to OK with a green checkmark. Assessors only tap items where they find an issue. Tapping opens an inline issue capture form (severity → photos → comment) that closes back to the list when saved.

### Severity-Driven Visual System
Issues are color-coded by severity throughout the app:

| Severity | Border | Icon | Tag color |
|---|---|---|---|
| OK | Green | CircleCheck | Green badge |
| Low | Soft yellow (70% opacity) | Warning triangle | Yellow tag |
| Medium | Yellow | Warning triangle | Yellow tag |
| High | Red | CircleCloseFilled | Red tag |

### Multi-Photo Capture per Issue
Each issue can hold multiple photos. The capture form shows a grid of thumbnails with a red X to remove each, plus an "Add" button that opens the native camera (`<input type="file" accept="image/*" capture="environment">`). Photos persist with the issue and can be viewed/added/deleted later by re-tapping the item.

### Inline Photo Display
Once an issue is saved, its photo thumbnails render directly under the item label even when collapsed — assessors can see what they captured without re-opening the form.

### Full-Screen Photo Zoom
Tap any thumbnail anywhere in the app (walk view, complete page, issue detail) to open a full-screen overlay with the photo at native resolution. Tap outside or the X to close.

### Editable Issues
Saved issues can be re-opened and fully edited: severity, comment, and photos. Changes save via API immediately.

### Zone-Guided Walk
Assessors progress through configured zones (Receiving, Picking, Packing, Dock, Restrooms, Stage, Projects) via horizontal pill tabs. Completed zones show a green check. A "Next Zone" button at the bottom advances; on the last zone the button becomes "Complete Assessment".

### Auto-Scoring (Green / Yellow / Red)
On completion the backend computes:
- `overall_score` = `((total_items - total_issues) / total_items) * 100`
- `overall_rating` = `RED` if any HIGH issue or score < 70, `YELLOW` if score < 90, `GREEN` otherwise

### Configurable Templates
Settings page lets non-developers manage:
- **Categories**: assessment groupings (e.g. Safety, Facility, Operations)
- **Checklist Items**: items grouped by zone within each category
- **Zones**: facility area definitions
- **Facilities**: warehouse locations (the wizard selects from this list, no free text)
- **Building Type Presets**: which categories are pre-checked when starting an assessment for each building type (New / Current / Closing / Consolidating)

### Issue Tracking Dashboard
Combined filters: status (Open / In Progress / Closed) × severity (Low / Medium / High) × facility. Result count updates live; "Clear all" resets all filters.

### Email Report Export
The Complete page has a "Send Report by Email" button that opens the user's email client with a pre-filled subject and body containing the score, zone breakdown with emoji indicators (🟢/🟡/🔴), each issue with severity/owner/due date, and a deep link back to the report.

## Database Schema

SQLite, single file at `backend/data/warehouse-assessment.db`. Tables created on first run; default data seeded if empty.

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `template` | Assessment categories (e.g. Safety, Facility) |
| `checklist_item` | Items within a template, grouped by zone |
| `zone_config` | Configurable facility zones |
| `facility` | Warehouse locations |
| `building_type_preset` | Default category selection per building type |
| `assessment` | Assessment instances |
| `issue` | Issues logged during an assessment (with `photo_filenames` JSON array) |

## Routes

| Path | View | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | HomeView | Dashboard with recent assessments and start button |
| `/assess/new` | AssessmentWizard | 3-step setup wizard |
| `/assess/:id/walk` | AssessmentWalk | Core zone-by-zone walkthrough |
| `/assess/:id/complete` | AssessmentComplete | Score summary, email export |
| `/issues` | IssuesDashboard | Filterable issue list |
| `/issues/:id` | IssueDetailView | Single issue editor |
| `/history` | HistoryView | Past completed assessments |
| `/settings` | SettingsView | Configuration management |

## Mobile Considerations

- Min tap target: 44px for all interactive elements
- Bottom navigation bar with safe-area inset padding for notch phones
- Native camera capture via `<input capture="environment">` (no upload dialog friction)
- Responsive container max-width 768px, centered on larger screens
- `touch-action: manipulation` and disabled `-webkit-tap-highlight-color` for native feel
- Dark theme default

## Reset / Clean State

Delete the SQLite DB to start fresh with seeded defaults:

```bash
rm -f backend/data/warehouse-assessment.db*
```

Photos are stored in `backend/uploads/` and persist independently.

## Deployment Notes

For sharing the demo via a public URL (e.g. Cloudflare Tunnel, ngrok, or your own server):

1. Configure your hostname via `.env.local` files (see [Optional: Expose via Tunnel](#optional-expose-via-tunnel-cloudflare-ngrok-etc) above) — no source code edits required.
2. Restrict access with an identity-aware proxy (e.g. Cloudflare Access) if sharing externally.
3. For a proper production build, run `npm run build` in `frontend/` and serve the static assets alongside the Express backend.
